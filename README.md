# YGO-DB Eco Mode

This is an **UNOFFICIAL** extension for the [Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Card Database](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/) that stops background animations and adds some style settings to reduce CPU and GPU usage.

**This extension injects the CSS into web pages. The `www.db.yugioh-card.com` domain disallows this operation, so this extension will not work properly when it's run on pages in the `www.db.yugioh-card.com` domain.**

* The author of this extension is independent of the creator and operator of the "Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Card Database"

## What it does

This extension just includes:

* a style sheet, "ydbeco.css", that is injected into any pages under "www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/"

The style sheet stops animations of the background image.
